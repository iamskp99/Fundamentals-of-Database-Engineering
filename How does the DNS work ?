Suppose you are asked to make a DNS system ?

So the naive idea that comes to our mind is to keep a centralized database and index it , make partition ,shard it and many other things but the thing is our internet hosts billion of websites and
it would take finite amount of time to run the query and get the ip address.


So how does it currently work ?
