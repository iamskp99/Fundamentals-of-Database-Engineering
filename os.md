# Process vs threads

Both processes and threads are fundamental units of execution in computing, but they have key differences in how they operate and how they are used. Here's a comparison:

### 1. **Definition**
   - **Process**: A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space. Each process runs in isolation from others, with its own resources like CPU, memory, and file descriptors.
   - **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within the same process, sharing the same memory and resources.

### 2. **Memory**
   - **Process**: Processes do not share memory. Each process has its own independent address space. Communication between processes requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as pipes, sockets, or shared memory.
   - **Thread**: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which makes communication between threads simpler and faster. However, this also introduces the risk of race conditions if threads try to modify shared data simultaneously.

### 3. **Context Switching**
   - **Process**: Switching between processes (context switching) is more expensive because the entire memory and register state need to be saved and restored. The operating system needs to switch to a new address space.
   - **Thread**: Switching between threads is faster than between processes, as threads share the same memory and address space. Only the CPU registers and stack need to be switched.

### 4. **Communication**
   - **Process**: Communication between processes is more complex because they are isolated. You need to use mechanisms like pipes, message queues, or sockets for them to communicate.
   - **Thread**: Threads can communicate easily and directly since they share memory. However, proper synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and locks are necessary to prevent issues like race conditions.

### 5. **Isolation and Stability**
   - **Process**: Since processes are isolated, a crash in one process does not affect other processes. Each process is independent of the others.
   - **Thread**: Since threads share memory, if one thread crashes or corrupts memory, it can affect the entire process and all other threads within it.

### 6. **Concurrency**
   - **Process**: Multiple processes can run concurrently but are more resource-intensive because of their isolation.
   - **Thread**: Threads provide more efficient concurrency within a single process because they share resources, making multi-threading a lighter-weight alternative.

### 7. **Use Cases**
   - **Process**: Used when you need isolation between tasks, such as in web servers handling different requests with separate processes or in sandboxed environments like web browsers.
   - **Thread**: Used when tasks are closely related and need to share memory or perform tasks concurrently within a single program, like in multi-threaded applications (e.g., a video editor or web browser).

### Summary Table:

| Feature            | Process                                 | Thread                                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Memory             | Independent, does not share             | Shares memory with other threads        |
| Context Switching  | Slower, more resource-intensive         | Faster, lightweight                     |
| Communication      | Uses IPC (pipes, sockets, etc.)         | Direct (shared memory)                  |
| Stability          | Isolated, crash does not affect others  | Shared, a crash can affect entire process |
| Use Case           | Tasks needing isolation                 | Tasks needing concurrency within a process |

Processes offer better isolation and stability, while threads are lighter and more efficient for concurrent tasks within the same application.
